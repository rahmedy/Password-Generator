# Password-Generator
This Application is for a user that needs a simple or complex password that is powered with JavaScript. This program will start once the user clicks the button and will ask the user to choose a number between 8 and 128 for the character length of the password. Once the user has selected the length, they will be shown a series of prompts about the type of characters they would like to include in their password. After the data is recorded, it will generate a random password with the characters the user wanted. This is all happening once the user clicks the button, which then calls on the function to do the rest.
